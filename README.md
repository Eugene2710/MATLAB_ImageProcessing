# MATLAB_ImageProcessing

#This MATLAB Image Processing repository is a set of code which filters an inserted image into black & white image and the resoltuion of the picture selectively. It serves as the fundamental code for further image processing techniques and was an invaluable lesson for me in my pursuit for programming knowledge and betterment.
